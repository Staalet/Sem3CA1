The plan for the next four days:

- Day 1-2: Concentrate on developing a chat server which can handle at least two clients. Before the end of day 2 you should   demonstrate your server to us!
- Day 3: Concentrate on writing your client and make sure you can connect to your server with multiple clients.
- Day 4: Re-visit your Tomcat server and Nginx proxy and setup the reverse proxy from Nginx to Tomcat. Try to get to a point where you can deploy your chat server to Digital Ocean.
